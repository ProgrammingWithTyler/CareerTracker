# ðŸ§¾ JT-001 â€“ Project Initialization & Angular Material Setup

- **Type:** Task
- **Status:** Done
- **Priority:** High
- **Assignee:** Tyler Johnson
- **Epic:** JT-000 â€“ CareerTracker MVP

## ðŸ“„ Description

Initialize the CareerTracker project using Angular 20 and Angular Material. This is the foundation of our job-tracking productivity tool, and weâ€™re setting it up with modular, enterprise-grade architecture. No bloat. No legacy garbage. Just clean, modern code from day one.

Weâ€™re using Angular Material to get solid, accessible components out of the box â€” a real-world skill for enterprise teams. SQLite will be handled on the backend later, but scaffold this front-end with a forward-thinking folder structure and setup.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

- Angular project scaffolded (Angular 20+, standalone component support OK)
- Angular Material integrated using CLI (`ng add @angular/material`)
- Default theme selected (recommend Azure/Blue or Custom if needed)
- Git repository initialized with `.gitignore` and `.editorconfig`
- Project builds and runs with placeholder homepage (basic layout, toolbar, etc.)
- Folder structure created:
  - `/components` â€“ Shared UI components
  - `/pages` â€“ Feature views (e.g., Dashboard, JobList)
  - `/services` â€“ API/service layer
  - `/models` â€“ Interfaces and data models
  - `/core` â€“ App-wide config, guards, interceptors
  - `/shared` â€“ Pipes, directives, UI helpers

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Project should be named CareerTracker.Web to reflect UI layer cleanly.
- Use standalone components where it simplifies things, but don't hesitate to group them under feature folders as needed.
- Routing and layout should follow Angular Material shell app pattern (sidenav, header, router-outlet).
- Don't worry about real data yet â€” mock service or placeholder components are fine for now.

## Comments

### ðŸš« SSR/SSG Decision

> **Decision:** Do NOT enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) at this time.

**Rationale:**

- CareerTracker is an internal-first productivity tool, not a public-facing or SEO-sensitive application.
- Client-side rendering (SPA) keeps complexity low and development speed high.
- Angular Universal and SSG features can be added later if needed for performance or SEO improvements.
- SSR introduces extra build steps, infrastructure, and potential debugging overhead that is unnecessary for MVP.

**CLI Response:**
```bash
Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? (y/N)
> N
```

### ðŸŽ¨ Theme Decision

> **Theme Chosen:** `Azure/Blue` (Angular Material default)

**Rationale:**

- Clean and professional color scheme
- Used widely in enterprise dashboards and apps
- Fastest path to production without needing custom SCSS variables or token overrides
- Matches the tone of a career-focused tool

**CLI Selection:**
```bash
? Choose a prebuilt theme name, or "custom" for a custom theme:
> Azure/Blue
```
