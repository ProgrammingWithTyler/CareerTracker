# 🧾 JT-002 - App Shell Component Setup

- **Type**: Task
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: High
- **Assignee**: Tyler Johnson
- **Epic**: JT-000 - CareerTracker MVP

## 📝 Description

Create the `AppShell` component that acts as the base layout for the application. This includes a toolbar, navigation area (optional for MVP), and router outlet placeholder. The shell should be styled using Angular Material with the Azure Blue prebuilt theme. This component will be the visual and structural wrapper for all routed pages in the CareerTracker app.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Shell component exists and is properly registered
- `<mat-toolbar>` visible and themed correctly
- `<router-outlet>` placed appropriately for dynamic content
- App bootstraps and renders the shell without errors
- Component uses standalone structure (Angular 20+ style)
- Verified against prebuilt theme (no custom theming in play)

### 📁 Suggested Structure

```plaintext
src/
├── app/
│   └── shell/
│       ├── shell.ts
│       ├── shell.html
│       └── shell.scss
```

## 🧠 Notes

- Keep the layout minimal and focused. No sidebar or nav needed unless scoped for a later ticket.
- Add a sample Material component inside to verify theme rendering (e.g., a `mat-icon`, `mat-button`, or even a sample `mat-card`).
- Keep SCSS clean. Minimal layout logic; treat this like a wireframe for now.
