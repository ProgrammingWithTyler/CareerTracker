# 🔧 JT-004 - Implement Responsive Navigation Menu with User Profile Dropdown

Type: Feature
Status: Done
Priority: Medium
Assignee: Tyler Johnson
Epic: JT-000 - CareerTracker MVP

## 📝 Description

- Create a navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes:
- On desktop, show all navigation links using p-menubar
- On mobile, collapse the navigation into a p-sidebar with a hamburger menu
- Include a user profile dropdown with “Profile,” “Settings,” and “Logout” (placeholders)
- Use PrimeNG components and maintain design consistency

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Navigation visible on desktop, collapsed into hamburger on smaller screens
- Clicking the hamburger shows/hides navigation links in sidebar
- User profile dropdown appears with placeholder items
- Keyboard-only navigation supported:
  - Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Escape behave as expected
  - Focus outlines are visible
- Design follows the current PrimeNG theme (Sky preset, light mode)
- Routing wired but routes can be placeholders
- Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile resolutions

## 🧠 Notes

- PrimeNG components (p-menubar, p-sidebar, p-panelMenu) were used for navigation
- All accessibility behaviors were verified manually:
  - Tab focuses items in logical order
  - Arrow keys navigate menus and submenus
  - Enter activates links, Escape closes menus
- PrimeNG’s built-in ARIA support handled accessibility without custom code
- Future refinement of theme (e.g. dark mode toggle) tracked separately
- Routing will be wired to working pages during content development in JT-005+
