## 📝 Description

Create the initial layout for the `/dashboard` page using PrimeFlex. This page will serve as the main entry point for users and should include a responsive widget grid.

We are scaffolding the layout now, and widgets will be wired with real data later. Use placeholder content (static text or dummy values) in each widget for now.

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- `DashboardPage` renders correctly inside `MainLayoutComponent`
- Use `p-grid` and `p-col-*` for widget placement
- Add the following components (can be stubs/placeholders for now):
  - `JobSummaryCardComponent`
  - `DeadlineTrackerWidgetComponent`
  - `RecentActivityListComponent`
- Widgets display side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Responsive spacing and padding applied via PrimeFlex
- Visual layout matches the grid zones defined in `ui-ux-strategy.md`

## 🧠 Notes

- This is a layout pass only—business logic can be added in later tickets
- Start with placeholder content and gradually replace with real data
- Use `class="p-col-12 p-md-6"` or similar to handle responsiveness
- Reference the `ui-ux-strategy.md` doc for component breakdowns

### 🧪 Accessibility

- Ensure tab order moves between widgets naturally
- Add role="region" or aria-labelledby as needed for screen readers (can be done later)
