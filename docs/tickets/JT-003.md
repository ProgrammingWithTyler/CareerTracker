# 🔧 JT-003 - UI migration from Angular Material to PrimeNG with global setup and responsive adjustments

- **Type**: Migration / Task
- **Status**: Done
- **Priority**: High
- **Assignee**: Tyler Johnson
- **Epic**: JT-000 - CareerTracker MVP

## 📝 Description

Migrate all Angular Material UI elements currently used in the project to PrimeNG components. This includes replacing toolbars, buttons, navigation, and layout wrappers. PrimeNG should be configured and installed globally, and the application should compile and render the updated components correctly.

Ensure responsive behavior is tested and consistent across device breakpoints.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Angular Material removed from package.json, all modules, imports, and stylesheets
- PrimeNG installed and configured globally
- Toolbar replaced using p-toolbar
- Navigation buttons replaced using p-button and PrimeNG layout utilities (PrimeFlex)
- App compiles without errors and loads shell correctly
- Styles visually consistent with original design (Azure Blue or darker theme)
- Navigation and routing fully functional with no regressions
- Shell layout preserved with PrimeNG-compatible markup

### 📦 Affected Files

```plaintext
src/
├── app/
│   ├── shell/
│   │   ├── shell.ts
│   │   ├── shell.html
│   │   └── shell.scss
│   └── app.routes.ts
├── styles.scss
angular.json (remove Angular Material styles, scripts)
package.json (remove Angular Material deps)
```

### 🧠 Notes

- Use PrimeFlex for layout alignment and spacing where needed
- Customize PrimeNG themes in a follow-up ticket if necessary
- This is a full migration, not a hybrid phase — remove all @angular/material usage once PrimeNG equivalents are stable
- Verify UI responsiveness and navigation on multiple devices/browsers
- Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
