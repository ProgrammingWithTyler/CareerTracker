## 📝 Description

We’re adding a **Job Detail Panel** that displays read-only information about a selected job from the Jobs table. It will eventually support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), but for now — we're going to **display static data based on selection**.

Think of it like a side drawer, modal, or embedded card that reacts when you click a row.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Job detail UI loads in the Jobs page when a user selects a row
- Use `p-panel`, `p-card`, or `p-sidebar` from PrimeNG for layout
- Fields to display:
  - Job Title
  - Company
  - Status
  - Applied Date
  - Source (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.)
  - Notes (optional)
- No form inputs — just read-only display
- Can be dismissed (close button or deselect)
- Responsive for mobile/desktop
- Keyboard accessible

```bash
ng g c pages/jobs/widgets/job-detail-panel --standalone --flat
```

## 📌 Design Notes

- Use `p-card` inside a `p-sidebar` for clean layout
- Style the fields using `p-grid` and spacing utilities
- Add a “Close” button with an `X` icon (top-right)
- Make sure it's **readable in dark mode**

## 🧠 Notes

- The Job Detail Panel is currently **read-only**, but it’s structured in a way that can support future features like editing or CRUD.
- Notes field is optional for now, but included to display interview notes or personal reminders when available.
- Based on early usability feedback (from actual behavior during mock interviews), users typically take notes outside the app. This panel is the **first step** toward consolidating that workflow.
- Panel layout is mobile-responsive and tested across screen sizes.
- Focus and keyboard accessibility are working as expected (tab through and Esc to close confirmed).
- Interaction logic is simple — panel visibility is tied to job selection via event binding.
